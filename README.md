# KGMap

Knowledge Graph Mapping Middelware for leveraging knowledge graphs by bridge between heterogeneous relational, social and linked data. It consists of three sub-models: the knowledge graph representation model, the sources metadata de-scription model, and the mapping model. 

KGMap maintains these models and defines different mapping cases. The main goal is to assist an expert identifying mapping candidates relying on an algorithm which calculate a similarity measure to determine relatedness between the sources metadata elements and knowledge graph schema elements. 

The implementation of the KGMap is a service-oriented middleware that relates entities about persons, organizations, and products from private enterprise CRM relational database with semi-structured Facebook social data and DBpedia dataset.
