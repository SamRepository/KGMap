# KGMap

**Knowledge Graph Mapping** is Middelware for leveraging knowledge graphs by bridge between heterogeneous relational, social and linked data. It consists of three sub-models: the _knowledge graph representation model_, the _sources metadata description model_, and the _mapping model_. 

KGMap maintains these models and defines different mapping cases. The main goal is to assist an expert identifying mapping candidates relying on an algorithm which calculate a similarity measure to determine relatedness between the sources metadata elements and knowledge graph schema elements. 

The implementation of the KGMap is a service-oriented middleware that relates entities about persons, organizations, and products from private enterprise CRM relational database with semi-structured Facebook social data and DBpedia dataset.
